## 1. Weather

This is a simple ReactJS project that uses a public API from [Weather Stack](https://weatherstack.com/).

The usage is very simple, you write down a valid name of a city, country, etc. And then the app will show you how the weather is doing in the written area.

## 2. Covid-19 Tracker

This is a ReactJS project that uses a public API from [Covid-19 API](https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/) that gives us free access on the statistics of Covid-19 virus.
